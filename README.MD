Section A: Code Review

Correctness:

The definition and declaration of the class is correct and it is called and used correctly.

The function def groupAnagrams on line 2 is indented incorrectly the function should be indented once, 
and the function definition from line 3 to line 10 is also indented incorrectly, it is supposed to be indented using twice after the function declaration to indicate that it is part of the function since python only takes things indented as part of the function definition to be part of the function if its not indented it is out of scope for the function.

The sorted function in line 5 has to take an argument to sort this is missing in the code, 
in this case it takes a single word in the list given by the letter i in the for loop.

The corrected function would be:

```
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        result = {}
        for i in strs:
            x = "".join(sorted(i))
            if x in result:
                result[x].append(i)
            else:
                result[x] = [i]
        return list(result.values())
    
ob1 = Solution()
print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))
```python

The function overall is very good, there were just some indentation errors and forgetting the word in the sorted() function but the class is unnecessary.

Efficiency:
The solution is very efficient, with the for loop taking O(n) time and the sort function taking O(m log m) time with n being the length of the array of words and m being the average length of each word, with sorted executed every time the loop iterates, the complexity becomes O(n * m log m) for the program. Which is very good overall for a simple solution.

Style and Documentation:
The recommended style for python variables and function names is lowercase separated by a underscore if the varaible name is two words to improve readability. 
The class name is correct starting with a capital if it were more that one word the next should be immediately after the first with no underscore inbetween, with the second word starting with a capital letter too.

For this task theres also no need for a class, since only one thing is being done in one function, to add a class makes the program verbose unnecessarily.

The variable names, and function and class name themselves are very description and are used correctly.

A space between the function definition and 'ob1 = Solution()' would improve readability.
No comments were added but the program itself is written in a descriptive way negating the need for much commenting, but some comments to add context and explain some choices would be helpful.

The program overall is very good, with the least time complexity for this task with very concise code, to achieve greater time complexity a dictionary could be used since dictinaries provide constant time lookups to check if the words are anagrams or not.



Section B: Projects

The project i am most proud of is my honours project i completed in 2022, it is a project started in hopes to use computer vision in the agricultural sector to scan and categorise plant disease to decrease the costs associated with plant management and help small scale farmers be more resilient to the adverse effects of plant diseases.
